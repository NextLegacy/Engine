# Naming

So the goal is to make a game engine.
And the idea is to "teaify" the submodules that make up the engine.

| Submodule | Teaified name | Acronym |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `Application` | `BoilingHotWater` | `BHW` |
| `Graphics` | `TeaCup` | `TC` |
| `ECS` or `IPCS` | `TeaBag` | `TB` |
| `Physics` | `SinkingSugarCubes` | `SSC` |
| `Audio` | `Steam` or to be more specifc `TeaKettle` | `TK` |
| `Engine` | `TeaPot` | `TP` |
